# DC Motor PID 

MATLAB ile **DC motorunun hız kontrolü** için tasarlanmıştır.  
The DC motor's power terminals were connected to the IBT-2 motor driver. The encoder’s outputs 
(yellow and white wires) were connected to the Arduino’s digital pins for feedback. The Arduino 
UNO board was programmed to act as an intermediary, sending PWM signals to the motor driver 
based on Simulink instructions.
